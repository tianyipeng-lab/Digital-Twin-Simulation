Suppose you were given $5 and had to decide how much of this money to keep for yourself and how much to send to another (anonymous) person. Any amount you send to the other person would then be tripled. That is, if you send $1, this becomes $3. If you send $2, this becomes $6, etc. Then, the other person would have to decide how much of that money to keep and how much to return to you. That is, if you send $1, this would become $3 and the other person would have to decide how much of this $3 to keep for themself and how much to send back to you. In this scenario, how much would keep for yourself and how much would you send to the other person?
