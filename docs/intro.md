# Introduction

This manual describes the hierarchical structure of the `persona_json` file that stores each individual response in the study. The structure is organized into two primary levels: **blocks**, and within each block, a set of **questions and corresponding answers**.

The survey is conducted across **four distinct waves**, and each block is associated with one of these waves. Blocks serve as thematic groupings of questions, which may vary in number and content. Within a wave, blocks and questions can be presented in a fixed or randomized order. In some cases, blocks or individual questions may be randomly selected for inclusion based on experimental conditions or display logic.

This manual provides a comprehensive listing of all possible question blocks and their contents. However, the actual set of questions encountered by each participant (or digital twin) may differ due to such randomization and conditional display mechanisms.
