Below are 24 different values that people rate of different importance in their lives. FIRST READ THROUGH THE LIST to familiarize yourself with all the values. While reading over the list, consider which ones tend to be most important to you and which tend to be least important to you. After familiarizing yourself with the list, rate the relative importance of each value to you as “A GUIDING PRINCIPLE IN MY LIFE.” It is important to spread your ratings out as best you can—be sure to use some numbers in the lower range, some in the middle range, and some in the higher range. Avoid using too many similar numbers. Work fairly quickly.
