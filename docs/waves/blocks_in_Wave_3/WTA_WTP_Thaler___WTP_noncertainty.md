Imagine that when you went to the movies last week, you were inadvertently exposed to a rare and fatal virus. The possibility of actually contracting the disease is 4 in 1,000, but once you have the illness there is no known cure. On the other hand, you can, readily and now, be given an injection that reduces the possibility of contracting the disease to 3 in 1,000. Unfortunately, these injections are only available in very small quantities and are sold to the highest bidder. What is the highest price you would be prepared to pay for such an injection?
