## Full Pipeline Demo

This notebook walks through the full pipeline of running a Digital Twin Simulation. It's the most comprehensive example and covers:
- Downloading the dataset
- Processing personas and questions
- Running LLM simulations
- Converting results to CSV format
- Running accuracy evaluations
- Performing pricing analysis
