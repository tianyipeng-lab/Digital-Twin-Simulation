Puzzle Grid (3x3 Matrix)

Each cell in a 3x3 matrix contains a circle with an arrow pointing in one of four directions (up, down, left, right) and sometimes includes a diagonal or horizontal/vertical line inside the circle. We'll label the grid as follows:

Top row (Row 1):
  Cell 1-1: Plain circle with arrow pointing up.
  Cell 1-2: Plain circle with arrow pointing right.
  Cell 1-3: Plain circle with arrow pointing down.

Middle row (Row 2):
  Cell 2-1: Circle with a horizontal line, arrow pointing left.
  Cell 2-2: Circle with a horizontal line, arrow pointing up.
  Cell 2-3: Circle with a horizontal line, arrow pointing right.

Bottom row (Row 3):
  Cell 3-1: Circle with a diagonal line from top-left to bottom-right, arrow pointing down.
  Cell 3-2: Circle with a diagonal line from top-left to bottom-right, arrow pointing left.
  Cell 3-3: Missing (marked with a question mark – this is what we are trying to determine).

Answer Choices (Labeled A to F):
  Each option consists of a circle, possibly with an internal line, and an arrow in a particular direction.
  A: Circle with horizontal line, arrow pointing up.
  B: Circle with diagonal line (top-left to bottom-right), arrow pointing left.
  C: Plain circle, arrow pointing left.
  D: Circle with diagonal line (top-left to bottom-right), arrow pointing right.
  E: Circle with diagonal line (top-left to bottom-right), arrow pointing down.
  F: Plain circle, arrow pointing up-right (diagonal).

Please indicate which is the best answer to complete the figure below.

STRUCTURE OF THE IMAGE:
The image is a 3x3 grid of figures (3 rows, 3 columns), with a six-option answer key (A-F) shown below the grid. The bottom-right cell of the 3x3 grid has a question mark (?) indicating a missing figure that needs to be deduced.

Each figure in the grid consists of a main geometric shape (e.g., circle, square, triangle, etc.) and often one or more smaller shapes (e.g., small circles, squares, or stars) placed beside or inside it. Shapes are typically split into black and white sections, often diagonally or horizontally.

GRID CONTENT:
First Row (Top Row):
  First Cell: A tall rectangle divided diagonally from top-left to bottom-right (left half black, right white). A small white circle sits above it.
  Second Cell: A square divided diagonally from bottom-left to top-right (bottom-left black, top-right white). A small black circle sits to the left of the square.
  Third Cell: A tall rectangle, identical to the first, with a small white circle below the rectangle.

Second Row (Middle Row):
  First Cell: A circle split horizontally in half (top half black, bottom half white). A small white star is on the right side.
  Second Cell: A circle split vertically in half (left half black, right white). A small white star is above it.
  Third Cell: A circle, again split horizontally (same as first), with the white star now on the left side.

Third Row (Bottom Row):
  First Cell: A vertical diamond shape split diagonally (top half white, bottom black). A small white square is to the left of the diamond.
  Second Cell: A right-pointing triangle split diagonally (left half black, right white). A small white square is below the triangle.
  Third Cell: A question mark (this is the missing figure to be deduced).

ANSWER OPTIONS (A–F):
  Each option is a figure with a main shape and a small white square positioned around it:
  A: Diamond shape (top white, bottom black), with square to the left.
  B: Right-pointing triangle (top black, bottom white), square below.
  C: Diamond shape (top white, bottom black), square on right.
  D: Right-pointing triangle (top white, bottom black), square below.
  E: Diamond shape (top black, bottom white), no small square.
  F: Right-pointing triangle (top black, bottom white), square on left.

**Question Type:** Multiple Choice

**Question Text:**

All the cubes below have a different image on each side. Select the choice that could represent a rotation of the cube labeled X

Main Cube (X)
Cube X shows three visible faces, each with a distinct symbol:
  Top face: A thick black plus sign with round ends on each arm (a sort of "medical cross" shape).
  Front-left face: A Y-shaped structure with three round nodes at the ends of each branch.
  Front-right face: A vertical line with rounded dots at both ends (like a thick vertical barbell).

Options (A to H)
Each of the options (A through H) shows a cube with three visible faces, each displaying a symbol. The goal is to determine which of these could be a rotation of Cube X — meaning it shows the same three symbols in any orientation, but without showing any new or different symbols.

Option A
  Top: Same plus sign as X.
  Front-left: Same Y-shaped symbol as X.
  Front-right: An oval with an outline (not seen on X).

Option B
  Top: A six-armed asterisk or snowflake shape (not seen on X).
  Front-left: Same vertical barbell symbol as X.
  Front-right: Oval (not on X).

Option C
  Top: Six-armed asterisk (not on X).
  Front-left: Oval (not on X).
  Front-right: Y-shape (same as on X).

Option D
  A box saying: "None of the cubes could be a rotation."

Option E
  Top: Six-armed asterisk (not on X).
  Front-left: Vertical barbell (same as X).
  Front-right: An X shape with rounded ends (not on X).

Option F
  Top: Same plus sign as X.
  Front-left: Vertical barbell (same as X).
  Front-right: Oval (not on X).

Option G
  Top: Vertical barbell (same as X).

All the cubes below have a different image on each side. Select the choice that could represent a rotation of the cube labeled X

The Task: You are given a cube labeled X and asked to find which one of the other cubes (A–C, E–G) could be a rotation of cube X. This means that the cube has the same symbols on the same faces, just oriented differently.

Cube X Description: Cube X shows three visible faces, each with a different symbol:
  A face with a plus-sign made of thick black bars, arranged diagonally (like an "X").
  A face with a Y-shaped symbol with thick dots at the ends.
  A face with a dumbbell-shaped symbol (a short line with dots at both ends).

Answer Choices:
  Cube A: Shows:
    The dumbbell.
    The plus/X symbol.
    The Y-shape.

  Cube B: Shows:
    The plus/X symbol.
    The dumbbell.
    A thick circle or ring (not on Cube X).

  Cube C: Shows:
    A different, more complex starburst-like symbol (not on Cube X).
    The dumbbell.
    The circle/ring.

  Cube D: States: "None of the cubes could be a rotation."

  Cube E: Shows:
    A complex starburst.
    The plus/X symbol.
    The dumbbell.

  Cube F: Shows:
    A starburst symbol.
    The Y-shape.
    The circle/ring.

  Cube G: Shows:
    The dumbbell.
    A starburst.
