**Question Text:**

You have recently graduated from university, obtained a good job, and are buying a new car. A newly designed seatbelt has just become available that would save the lives of 98% of the 500 drivers a year who are involved in a type of head-on-collision. (Approximately half of these fatalities involve drivers who were not at fault.) The newly designed seatbelt is not yet standard on most car models. However, it is available as a $500 option for the car model that you are ordering. How likely is it that you would order your new car with this optional seatbelt?

**Options:**

* very unlikely

* unlikely

* somewhat unlikely

* somewhat likely

* likely

* very likely
